# Finger

Have you ever wanted to finger your friends? This Minecraft plugin will display information about another player similar to [finger(1)](https://manpage.me/?finger) in [UNIX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFUlAQZB9Ng).

## Usage

```
/finger [USER]
```

![Screenshot](finger.png)

Output includes:

* Username
* Level
* World Location
* Ping
* Idle Time
* Health
* Hunger
* Meters Walked
* Blocks Mined
* Kills
* Damage Dealt
* Deaths
* Item Held
* Armor Stats

## Building

```
mvn package
```

## Installation

```
cp target/Finger-1.0.0.jar ~/minecraft/plugins
```

## Setup

When the server starts, these files will be written to the `plugins/Finger` folder if they don't exist:

* `config.yml`
* `template.html`

If you are using a permissions plugin, you can allow access to `/finger` using the `finger.use` permission. By default, only operators can use this command. The server must be restarted after changes are made.

## üï∑Ô∏è Web Page

This is an optional feature that will write a flat HTML file to disk every minute.

You can also write the same information to an HTML page by adding a path to `config.yml` under the `html_player_report` option e.g.

```
html_player_report: /var/www/html/players.html
```

The process running Minecraft must have write access to the specified directory. If you have enabled this feature and the HTML file never appears, check your console for an error like this:

```
[11:32:49 WARN]: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /var/www/html/players.html (Permission denied)
```

You can also optionally set the `server_name` option e.g.

```
server_name: My Minecraft Server
```

This maps to the `{SERVER_NAME}` placeholder in the template.

## üìù Template Placeholders

The HTML template can be modified as you like. All placeholders are optional, removing them will not cause problems.

## **üîπ Player-Specific Placeholders**
These placeholders are used **inside** the **player-card template** and contain **per-player** details.

## üöô Under the Hood

Every minute, the JSON file `plugins/Finger/player_data.json` is written. The format of this file is:

```
{
    "MINECRAFT_USER_ID": {
        "damage_dealt": 440.398380279541,
        "distance_walked": 38062.187168638084,
        "mobs_killed": 18,
        "blocks_mined": 1980,
        "deaths": 3
    }
}
```

Do not edit this file wile the server is running or your changes will be lost. These counts are running totals since the plugin was installed.
